8/19/24 - I am learning about SDK's and their functionality. When maile and I get home I want to focus on the changes 
that devin and I talked about to get going on the finalization of this testing tool. 
Continue to press in daily. Don't shy away from the unknown or failure. Failure produces growth. 

8/20/24 - focused on getting our place setup. Need to start getting into a daily habit of coding, research and exploring problems.
I want to get better at reading and understanding documentation. I want to continue to ask devin questions and see how I can grow. 
- questions - any literature or extra reading/materials he would suggest I look to consume
- business questions - What was the Y combinator like and what did you learn from it? 
How do you know if an idea is worth pursuing in your opinion?s
